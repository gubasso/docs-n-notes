## Study

exercism.io lesson:

The problem with the generic approach on the value is that it must work with both numeric and string values in the tests, which is impractical, as strings aren't inherently even or odd. Also, the tests specify to choose "even-positioned items from the iterator", not even values.

If wanting to constrain a type to numeric types, you might find this SO thread to have some good advice.
