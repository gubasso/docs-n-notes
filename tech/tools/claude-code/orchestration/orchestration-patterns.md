# Orchestration Patterns

Reusable patterns for multi-stage workflows that orchestrate Codex via `codex-session`. These
patterns appear across `prex`, `prex-resume`, `plan-exec`, `review-loop`, and `spec-impl`.

Skills implement these patterns using their own variable names and stage numbers. This file defines
the **contracts and shapes** — not the orchestration logic itself.

## Sandbox Detection Probe

Before the first Codex call in a workflow, determine whether the native bwrap sandbox works. The
canonical probe and fallback patterns are defined in
[`codex-conventions.md`](../codex-conventions.md) §Sandbox Detection Probe and §Fallback Patterns.

- Run once per workflow, not per stage.
- Persist `SANDBOX_MODE` by substituting its literal value in subsequent commands (shell state does
  not persist between Bash tool invocations).
- Use the Bash tool timeout of `30000ms` for the probe.
- If fallback: inform the user in one line.

## Proof-of-Delegation

When delegating work to a subagent via the **Agent tool** (`subagent_type: general-purpose`), wrap
the delegation in a snapshot/diff/validate pattern to confirm the subagent actually did the work.

### Contract

1. **Pre-snapshot** — capture the run directory state before delegation:

   ```bash
   find "$RUN_DIR" -type f -printf '%p %T@\n' 2>/dev/null | sort > "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-pre.snap"
   rm -f "$RUN_DIR/<PROOF_DIFF>" "$RUN_DIR/<OUTPUT_FILE>"
   ```

2. **Delegate** — invoke the Agent tool (never the Skill tool for nested delegation; see
   `_docs/development/claude-code/skills-and-orchestration.md` §Dispatch vs Delegation).

3. **Post-snapshot and diff** — capture the state after delegation returns:

   ```bash
   find "$RUN_DIR" -type f -printf '%p %T@\n' 2>/dev/null | sort > "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-post.snap"
   diff -u "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-pre.snap" "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-post.snap" \
     > "$RUN_DIR/<PROOF_DIFF>" || true
   ```

4. **Validate** — fail closed on missing evidence:

   ```bash
   [ -s "$RUN_DIR/<OUTPUT_FILE>" ] || {
     echo "ERROR: delegated work did not produce $RUN_DIR/<OUTPUT_FILE>"
     exit 1
   }
   [ -s "$RUN_DIR/<PROOF_DIFF>" ] || {
     echo "ERROR: no proof of delegated activity in $RUN_DIR"
     exit 1
   }
   ```

### Rules

- Do not retry automatically on proof failure. Report the error and ask the user.
- Do not fall back to inline work if delegation fails — the point is separation of concerns.
- The proof diff serves as an audit trail: it shows which files the subagent created or modified.

### Variant: External directory proof

For delegations that create artifacts outside `$RUN_DIR` (e.g., `review-loop` creates
`/tmp/review-loop-*`), use the same pattern but snapshot the external directory:

```bash
find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '<PATTERN>-*' -printf '%p\n' 2>/dev/null \
  | sort > "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-pre.snap"
# ... delegate ...
find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '<PATTERN>-*' -printf '%p\n' 2>/dev/null \
  | sort > "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-post.snap"
diff -u ... > "$RUN_DIR/<PROOF_DIFF>" || true
NEW_DIR="$(comm -13 "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-pre.snap" "$RUN_DIR/<STAGE>-post.snap" | tail -1)"
```

## Lock File Management

Multi-stage workflows use lock files to prevent concurrent sessions from interfering.

### Contract

- **Location**: `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/`
- **Naming**: `<workflow>-active-<suffix>` where suffix is derived from the run directory (basename
  suffix or SHA1 hash of the realpath).
- **Contents**: two lines — the `$RUN_DIR` path and the owning PID (`$PPID`).
- **Creation**: atomic via write-to-tmp + `mv`.

  ```bash
  printf '%s\n%s\n' "$RUN_DIR" "$PPID" > "${LOCK_FILE}.tmp" \
    && mv "${LOCK_FILE}.tmp" "$LOCK_FILE"
  ```

- **Release**: `rm -f "$LOCK_FILE"` before any user-facing pause (approval loops, user questions).
- **Reacquisition**: recreate the lock before resuming execution after user approval.
- **Orphan detection**: a Stop hook or coordinator checks whether the owning PID is still alive. If
  the PID is dead or the `$RUN_DIR` no longer exists, the lock is stale and can be cleaned up.

## Review-Loop Handoff

When a workflow hands off to the `review-loop` skill for iterative Codex review + Claude fix cycles,
it constructs a JSON file and delegates via the Agent tool.

### Handoff JSON schema

```json
{
  "task": "<contents of request.md>",
  "reviewed_plan": "<contents of stage2-reviewed-plan.md>",
  "stage4_review": "<contents of stage4-review.md>",
  "plan_thread_id": "<PLAN_THREAD_ID or null>",
  "impl_thread_id": "<IMPL_THREAD_ID or null>"
}
```

Write the JSON to `$RUN_DIR/review_loop_input.json`. The review-loop skill parses this for task
context, the reviewed plan, and prior findings, then captures the live git diff independently.

### Delegation prompt template

```text
Read the skill file at $HOME/.claude/skills/review-loop/SKILL.md and follow
its "handoff mode". Your single argument is:

  <RUN_DIR>/review_loop_input.json

Run the full review loop the skill describes, write the final summary.md to
the review-loop run directory the skill creates, and return a one-line reply
containing that run directory path.
```

Use `subagent_type: general-purpose` (not the Skill tool). Wrap the delegation in the
proof-of-delegation pattern (§Proof-of-Delegation, external directory variant) using
`/tmp/review-loop-*` as the pattern.

### Validation

After delegation, locate the child run directory and validate:

- `$RL_RUN_DIR/summary.md` exists and is non-empty.
- The proof diff shows a new `/tmp/review-loop-*` directory was created.

Fail closed on missing proof. Do not retry automatically.
