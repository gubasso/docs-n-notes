# Viewport

### ✅ CSS Viewport Height Units – Use These Instead of `vh`:

| Unit   | Meaning                            | Best Use Case                            |
|--------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `vh`   | 1% of **viewport height**          | ❌ Problematic on mobile (UI bars ignored) |
| `dvh`  | **Dynamic** Viewport Height        | ✅ Mobile apps, full-height menus          |
| `svh`  | **Small** Viewport Height          | ✅ Landing pages, avoids layout shifts     |
| `lvh`  | **Large** Viewport Height          | ❌ Like `vh`, ignores mobile UI changes    |

### 🔁 Fallback Strategy (for older browsers):
```css
height: 100vh;
height: 100dvh; /* Overrides if supported */
```

---

### ⚠️ Notes:
- `dvh` adapts to UI bars (good, but may cause small layout shifts).
- `svh` avoids shifts but always assumes UI bars are present.
- `lvh` ignores UI bars entirely (similar to old `vh`).
- **Keyboard overlays are *not* considered** by any of these units.
