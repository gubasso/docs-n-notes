# Problem to Tool

**Problems --> Techniques**

```
- Ordered Arrays or Sequences    +
| Sliding Window Problems        +-->  Two Poiters
| Palindromes or Symmetry        |      O(n)
- Merging / Comparing Two Arrays +
- subsequences
```

```
- Subarrays                     +
- Subarray "valid"              |
  - some constraint             |
- find this valid subarray      +--> Sliding Window
  - the best (longest, etc)...  |     O(2n) -> O(n)
  - number of valid subarrays...+
- If a problem has explicit constraints such as:
  - Sum greater than or less than k
  - Limits on what is contained, such as the maximum of k unique elements or no duplicates allowed
  - And/or asks for:
- Minimum or maximum length
- Number of subarrays/substrings
- Max or minimum sum
```

- sums of subarray -> Prefix sum

- subsequences -> dynamic programming
               -> two pointers


- counting / frequency -> hashmap

- subsets -> backtracking
- combinations
  - backtracking
