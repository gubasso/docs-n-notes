# Docker Secrets


Person:
- at my compose.yaml file I have this service:

```yaml
  api:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfiles/brag-server/Dockerfile
    entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
    volumes:
      - ./entrypoint.sh:/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
    secrets:
      - database_url
```

And this `secrets` section:

```yaml
secrets:
  postgres_password:
    environment: "POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
  database_url:
    environment: "DATABASE_URL"
```

at the `entrypoint.sh` file, I have this content that is suposed to load the `DATABASE_URL` env variable to be available inside the container, to the binary that will be executed:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Read text from secret file
DATABASE_URL="$(cat /run/secrets/database_url)"
export DATABASE_URL
# Call the original entrypoint script
...
```

How do I finish this `entrypoint.sh` file correctly so the only thing it does is to load this environment variable and continue the normal docker execution?

ChatGPT:
- To finish your `entrypoint.sh` script in a way that loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable from a Docker secret and then continues with the normal Docker execution, you need to execute the original command passed to the Docker container. This is typically done by using the `exec` command in the shell script to replace the current shell with the specified command.

Here's how you can modify your `entrypoint.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read text from secret file and export it as an environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="$(cat /run/secrets/database_url)"

# Execute the command passed as arguments to the entrypoint script
exec "$@"
```

In this script:
1. The `export DATABASE_URL=...` line reads the content of the `database_url` secret and exports it as an environment variable.
2. The `exec "$@"` line is crucial. The `"$@"` is a shell parameter that expands to the original command-line arguments (preserving any spaces and special characters). The `exec` command replaces the current shell with the command you're executing, which is the standard way to end an `entrypoint.sh` script. This ensures that the command Docker was originally going to run (defined in the Dockerfile's `CMD` or overridden in the `docker-compose.yml`) is executed as the main process of the container.

By using this approach, your `entrypoint.sh` script sets up the environment variable from the Docker secret and then proceeds to execute the container's main process as if the `entrypoint.sh` script weren't there, which is typically what you want in a custom entrypoint script.

Person:
- Ok... I saw an example of this explanation for a postgresql docker image... and the `entrypoint.sh` that was given was like this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Read text from secret file
DATABASE_URL="$(cat /run/secrets/database_url)"
export DATABASE_URL
# Call the original entrypoint script
exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres
```

Why did this example user the last line as it is instead of just `exec "$@"`?

ChatGPT:
- The difference in how the last line of the `entrypoint.sh` script is written—using `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres` instead of `exec "$@"`—depends on the specific requirements or intentions of the Docker image and how it's supposed to be used.

In the case of the PostgreSQL Docker image, or similar cases, here are some possible reasons for using `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`:
1. **Specific Entry Point** : The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script is a well-known script in many official Docker images, including PostgreSQL. This script is designed to set up the environment and prepare the service (in this case, PostgreSQL) to run correctly. By explicitly calling `docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`, the custom `entrypoint.sh` ensures that the original setup process for PostgreSQL is followed.
2. **Default Command** : The `postgres` argument is likely the default command that would be used to start the PostgreSQL server. If most users of the image will be using this default, then hardcoding it into the custom entrypoint script simplifies usage and ensures consistency.
3. **Control Over Command** : Using `exec "$@"` would execute whatever command is passed to the Docker container. In some scenarios, you might want more control over what command gets executed, especially if you are setting up a specialized environment or have specific requirements. Hardcoding the command (like `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`) ensures that your environment setup is always followed by the execution of a specific, intended command.
4. **Customization for Specific Use-Cases** : Sometimes, the default behavior of the Docker image might not perfectly align with the needs of a specific project. In such cases, a custom `entrypoint.sh` allows for tweaking the startup process or the environment before executing the intended primary process.

To summarize, using `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres` is a more targeted approach, ensuring that the PostgreSQL service starts with the expected configuration and environment. It's a way to combine custom setup steps (like setting environment variables from Docker secrets) with the standard initialization process of the PostgreSQL Docker image.
