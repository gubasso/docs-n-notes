# SelfHosted Gateway vs NetBird (overlay VPN)

**Core Architectural Difference**

- **SelfHosted Gateway** is essentially a **single gateway container** (running on your VPS) + a
  **client container** (on your home/server) that establish a **WireGuard tunnel** and auto-generate
  an HTTP(S) reverse-proxy configuration. All inbound traffic to `*.yourdomain.com` hits the VPS,
  then gets securely forwarded over WireGuard into your local Docker apps.

- **NetBird (an overlay VPN)** spins up a **full mesh** of WireGuard peers. Every machine running
  the NetBird agent joins an encrypted, peer-to-peer network, is assigned a private VPN IP (e.g.
  `100.x.x.x`), and can talk to any other allowed peer directly—no centralized HTTP proxy at all
  ([netbird.io][1], [docs.netbird.io][2]).

| **Connectivity**           | One-to-site: VPS ↔ client server                                                        | Full mesh: any peer ↔ any peer directly ([netbird.io][1])                                                                                                     |
| **Protocols supported**    | HTTP(S) only (via Docker-generated reverse proxy)                                       | **Any** TCP/UDP (SSH, RDP, SMB, databases, custom apps)                                                                                                       |
| **DNS & discovery**        | Uses your public domain + subdomains                                                    | Uses virtual IPs (e.g. `100.x.x.x`) on the VPN—no public DNS required, though you can layer DNS on top if you like ([LIBTECHNOPHILE][3])                      |
| **Access control & users** | Implicit: whoever hits your subdomain                                                   | Fine-grained ACLs, groups, SSO/MFA integration, per-peer policies, audit logs ([GitHub][4])                                                                   |
| **NAT traversal**          | Outbound SSH only                                                                       | Built-in NAT traversal (UDP hole punching) for mesh connectivity ([FreshPorts][5])                                                                            |
| **Scalability**            | Ideal for exposing a **handful** of web services                                        | Scales to **dozens–hundreds** of nodes/devices, across home, offices, cloud, containers, IoT, etc.                                                            |
| **Deployment complexity**  | Very light: a couple `make` commands + DNS A-record                                     | Requires running a coordination server (self-hosted or cloud), installing agents on each peer, managing certificates/policies (though tooling is streamlined) |
| **Use-case focus**         | “I just want my web apps accessible from outside, without punching holes in my router.” | “I need a private LAN-like network across multiple devices and protocols, with user-based access and mesh routing.”                                           |

## When to Choose Each

### 🏠 SelfHosted Gateway

- You’re **only** exposing one or a few **web-based** services (e.g. Nextcloud, Home Assistant,
  internal dashboards).
- Your ISP blocks/CGNATs inbound ports, and you want a **zero-port-forwarding** solution.
- You’d rather not manage a full VPN mesh or deal with virtual IP addressing.
- You want a super-lightweight, Docker-first setup: one container on a cheap VPS + one on your home
  machine.

### 🌐 NetBird (Overlay VPN)

- You need **SSH**, **RDP**, **SMB**, database access, or any non-HTTP protocols across your
  devices.
- You’re connecting **multiple** devices (laptops, servers, containers, IoT) in different locations
  into one flat, secure network.
- You want **user authentication**, **ACLs**, **SSO/MFA**, group-based policies, and auditability.
- You’re comfortable running a small “coordination” server (or using NetBird’s cloud) and installing
  an agent on every peer.

---

**Bottom line**:

- If your goal is **simple, secure external access** to a handful of web apps behind CGNAT—go with
  **SelfHosted Gateway**.
- If you need a **full-blown, zero-trust, multi-protocol mesh** network spanning dozens of
  devices—go with **NetBird** (or another overlay VPN).
