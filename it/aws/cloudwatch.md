# AWS CloudWatch

- CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service for AWS resources and applications
- It collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events
- CloudWatch Logs lets you centralize the logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services
- You can then analyze the log data, set alarms, and create visualizations
- CloudWatch itself does not provide auditing capabilities, but it can ingest and store logs from auditing sources like CloudTrail
