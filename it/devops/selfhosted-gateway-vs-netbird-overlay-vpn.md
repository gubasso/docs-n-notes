# SelfHosted Gateway vs NetBird (overlay VPN)

**Core Architectural Difference**

* **SelfHosted Gateway** is essentially a **single gateway container** (running on your VPS) + a **client container** (on your home/server) that establish a **WireGuard tunnel** and auto-generate an HTTP(S) reverse-proxy configuration. All inbound traffic to `*.yourdomain.com` hits the VPS, then gets securely forwarded over WireGuard into your local Docker apps.

* **NetBird (an overlay VPN)** spins up a **full mesh** of WireGuard peers. Every machine running the NetBird agent joins an encrypted, peer-to-peer network, is assigned a private VPN IP (e.g. `100.x.x.x`), and can talk to any other allowed peer directly‚Äîno centralized HTTP proxy at all ([netbird.io][1], [docs.netbird.io][2]).

| **Protocols supported**    | HTTP(S) only (via Docker-generated reverse proxy)                                       | **Any** TCP/UDP (SSH, RDP, SMB, databases, custom apps)                                                                                                       |

| **Access control & users** | Implicit: whoever hits your subdomain                                                   | Fine-grained ACLs, groups, SSO/MFA integration, per-peer policies, audit logs ([GitHub][4])                                                                   |

| **Deployment complexity**  | Very light: a couple `make` commands + DNS A-record                                     | Requires running a coordination server (self-hosted or cloud), installing agents on each peer, managing certificates/policies (though tooling is streamlined) |
| **Use-case focus**         | ‚ÄúI just want my web apps accessible from outside, without punching holes in my router.‚Äù | ‚ÄúI need a private LAN-like network across multiple devices and protocols, with user-based access and mesh routing.‚Äù                                           |

## When to Choose Each

### üè† SelfHosted Gateway

* You‚Äôre **only** exposing one or a few **web-based** services (e.g. Nextcloud, Home Assistant, internal dashboards).
* Your ISP blocks/CGNATs inbound ports, and you want a **zero-port-forwarding** solution.
* You‚Äôd rather not manage a full VPN mesh or deal with virtual IP addressing.
* You want a super-lightweight, Docker-first setup: one container on a cheap VPS + one on your home machine.

### üåê NetBird (Overlay VPN)

* You need **SSH**, **RDP**, **SMB**, database access, or any non-HTTP protocols across your devices.
* You‚Äôre connecting **multiple** devices (laptops, servers, containers, IoT) in different locations into one flat, secure network.
* You want **user authentication**, **ACLs**, **SSO/MFA**, group-based policies, and auditability.
* You‚Äôre comfortable running a small ‚Äúcoordination‚Äù server (or using NetBird‚Äôs cloud) and installing an agent on every peer.

---

**Bottom line**:

* If your goal is **simple, secure external access** to a handful of web apps behind CGNAT‚Äîgo with **SelfHosted Gateway**.
* If you need a **full-blown, zero-trust, multi-protocol mesh** network spanning dozens of devices‚Äîgo with **NetBird** (or another overlay VPN).
