# Complexity Heuristic & Round-Splitting Rules

Shared classification system for implementation plans. Determines the complexity grade and how to
split work into rounds.

## Five scoring axes

Evaluate the implementation surface along each axis (score 1–4):

| Axis                   | 1 (Low)           | 2 (Medium)        | 3 (High)            | 4 (Very High)     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Files to change        | 1–3               | 4–8               | 9–15                | 16+               |
| Cross-cutting concerns | None              | 1 (e.g., logging) | 2–3                 | 4+                |
| Dependency chains      | Independent steps | Linear chain      | Diamond deps        | Complex DAG       |
| Pattern novelty        | All existing      | 1 new pattern     | 2–3 new patterns    | New architecture  |
| Risk / blast radius    | Isolated module   | Single subsystem  | Multiple subsystems | Core/shared infra |

## Executor profile

The grade thresholds below are calibrated against an **Executor Factor (EF)** that reflects what the
round-runner can absorb in one session. The default executor is `prex`, which runs four model passes
per round (Codex plan → Claude review → Codex implement → Claude review-loop with fixes). Because
the review-loop catches and fixes mid-round, a `prex` round can absorb meaningfully more raw
complexity than a single-shot model.

| Executor profile | EF  | When it applies                                                           |
| ---------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prex` (default) | 1.5 | Codex plan + Codex implement + Claude review-loop. Default for this repo. |
| `single-pass`    | 1.0 | One capable model, no in-round review gate. Raw score stands.             |
| `limited`        | 0.8 | Weaker model or constrained context. Bumps complexity up.                 |

See `plan-lifecycle.md` § "Executor capacity model" for the prex pipeline details.

## Grade mapping

1. Sum the five axis scores → **raw score** (range 5–20).
2. Divide by the EF for the selected executor → **adjusted score**.
3. Map the adjusted score to a grade:

| Grade  | Adjusted  | Rounds | Notes                                                    |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**  | ≤ 7.0     | 1      | Simple, focused change. One prex run handles it easily.  |
| **M**  | 7.1–11.0  | 1      | Meaty but cohesive. One prex run, possibly a longer one. |
| **L**  | 11.1–15.0 | 2–3    | Multi-round. Needs thoughtful splitting.                 |
| **XL** | ≥ 15.1    | 4–8    | Complex. `STRATEGY.md` generated. Careful orchestration. |

The adjusted-score thresholds are exactly the historical raw thresholds (5–7 / 8–11 / 12–15 / 16+),
so a `single-pass` executor (EF=1.0) recovers the old behavior precisely. Under `prex` (EF=1.5) a
borderline raw 8 → adjusted 5.33 → S (was M), borderline raw 12 → adjusted 8.0 → M (was L), and raw
20 → adjusted 13.33 → L (was XL): borderline tasks demote one grade, which is the intended effect of
the in-round review-loop. Under `limited` (EF=0.8) the same boundaries promote borderline tasks by
one grade.

## Override guidance

The axes are structured judgment aids, not a rigid formula. Override when:

- **Bump up**: Few files but each requires 500+ lines of new code. Or the change is
  security-sensitive regardless of size. Or the implementation requires unfamiliar technology.
- **Bump down**: Many files but the change is mechanical (e.g., rename across 20 files). Or the
  codebase has strong test coverage that de-risks the change.

When overriding, note the reason in the plan's README.md under Decisions & Constraints.

## Round-splitting rules

When the grade is L or XL, split the implementation into rounds. Apply these rules in priority
order:

1. **Module/subsystem boundaries** — group changes by the module they touch. Changes to the auth
   module go in one round; changes to the API layer go in another.

2. **Layer boundaries** — if the change spans layers, split bottom-up: data layer before business
   logic before API before UI. Each layer round produces a stable foundation for the next.

3. **Dependency order** — if round 2 depends on artifacts from round 1 (new types, new modules),
   they must be separate rounds. Never create circular dependencies between rounds.

4. **Cohesion over file count** — each round should deliver one coherent user-visible feature or one
   architectural layer. File count is incidental; mechanically-coupled changes belong together
   regardless of count. When the executor is `prex`, prefer fewer, larger, cohesive rounds — the
   in-round review-loop already de-risks size. When the executor is `limited`, prefer smaller
   rounds. The hard ceiling in all cases is work completable in one Codex 600s session.

5. **Atomic changes** — never split an atomic change across rounds. A type definition and all its
   consumers belong in the same round. A migration and the code that uses the new schema belong
   together.

6. **Foundations first** — shared foundations (types, interfaces, utilities, configuration) go in
   round 01. Consumer code goes in subsequent rounds.

7. **Tests with code** — tests go in the same round as the code they test. Exception: a dedicated
   integration/e2e testing round at the end, when the test suite exercises cross-round interactions.

## Reporting the classification

After classification, report to the user:

- The grade (S/M/L/XL) with a one-sentence rationale.
- The per-axis scores plus the executor factor (brief, not a full table — e.g., "files:2 cross-cut:1
  deps:2 novelty:3 risk:2 → raw 10 ÷ EF 1.5 (prex) → 6.7 → M").
- For L/XL: the proposed round split with topic summaries. Get user confirmation before generating.
