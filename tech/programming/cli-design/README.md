# CLI Design — General Principles

Language-agnostic principles for designing command-line programs: architecture, logging, errors,
config, coding style, agent-aware design, and wrapper patterns. Use this tree as the source of truth
when bootstrapping a new CLI, and the language-specific `cli-spec/` directories for implementation
details.

## How to use this tree

1. Read [00 — Architecture](00-architecture.md) first. It defines the vocabulary the other chapters
   assume (parse-shape vs runtime-shape, `cli/` vs `commands/` vs `domain/`, etc.).
1. When a design question comes up, search the chapter that owns it.
1. Cross-link to the appropriate language-specific spec for code-level patterns.

## Language-specific implementation

These chapters apply the general principles in a specific language. They assume you've read the
matching general chapter.

- [`tech/languages/rust/cli-spec/`](../../languages/rust/cli-spec/) — clap, thiserror + anyhow,
  tracing, figment, assert_cmd + insta.
- [`tech/languages/python/cli-spec/`](../../languages/python/cli-spec/) — Typer, Pydantic,
  structlog/rich.
- [`tech/languages/bash/cli-spec/`](../../languages/bash/cli-spec/) — strict mode, lib/ + bin/
  layout, shellcheck, bats.

## TL;DR (the irreducible defaults)

- **Two output layers, never mix them.** stdout = data, stderr = UX, file = forensic log.
- **Default-log to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/<app>/<app>.log`** in structured `key=value` (or JSON), no ANSI.
  Terminal mirror is opt-in.
- **`CLI > env > project file > user file > defaults`** for every knob.
- **Typed errors with stable `err.kind` per variant.** BSD sysexits exit codes. Unit-test the
  matrix.
- **Parse, don't validate.** At every boundary (CLI, file, network), strings → precise types once.
- **One `AppContext`, built in `main`, passed by reference.** No globals.
- **`pub`/`pub(crate)`/private discipline.** Default to the least visibility that works.
- **`--help` is documentation.** Treat `--help` and `man` pages as part of the API.
- **`--json` for everything machine-readable.** LLM agents, CI scripts, and pipes will thank you.
