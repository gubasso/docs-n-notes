# Binary Search

- [Construct a complete binary tree from given array in level order fashion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-complete-binary-tree-given-array/)

- [Good Binary Search Problems](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/solutions/3266855/all-binary-search-problems/)

"In this type of questions (where question want some minimum/ maximum / at least ) we use concept of Binary search"[^1]

[5.1 Graph Traversals - BFS & DFS -Breadth First Search and Depth First Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKY4hjDrxk)

- objective: find the shortest path on unweighted graphs

- time complexity: O(v+e) (vertices + edges)

explores nodes in layer:
- start node: explore neighbours (1 layer)
- neighbours (1): explores their neighbours (2)
- neighbours (2): ...
