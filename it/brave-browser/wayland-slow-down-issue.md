Below is a concise guide to diagnosing and fixing Brave’s graphical hangs and sluggishness under Arch Linux with KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland. In summary, most issues stem from Brave’s default Ozone platform fallback to X11, hardware‐acceleration quirks, and lingering compositor‐ or driver‐specific bugs. Applying the right launch flags (or configuration file), toggling hardware acceleration, or—even temporarily—switching to X11 can resolve the majority of freezes, stutters, and rendering glitches.

## Common Symptoms

### Graphical Glitches

Users report large portions of the screen or entire Brave windows going black or not rendering page content under Plasma 6 Wayland, even when other applications remain unaffected ([Brave Community][1]).

### Intermittent Freezes & Stuttering

Brave may freeze every few seconds—stuttering during scrolling or video playback—while other Chromium‐based browsers behave normally ([Brave Community][2]).

### Drag-and-Drop Crashes

Selecting and dragging text or tabs in Brave can cause an immediate freeze and force a restart, tied to Wayland’s drag‐and‐drop implementation within Ozone ([GitHub][3]).

---

## Underlying Causes

### Ozone Platform Fallback to X11

By default, Brave’s “Preferred Ozone Platform” flag is set to **X11**, even when booted into Wayland. This mismatch leads to compositor‐level conflicts and flickering ([Brave Community][4]).

### Hardware Acceleration & GPU Drivers

Wayland sessions on NVIDIA (proprietary) or Intel GPUs can suffer from incomplete support for “passthrough” or GSP firmware, causing low frame rates or stuttering in all browsers ([NVIDIA Developer Forums][5]).

### KDE Plasma 6 Wayland Stability

Plasma 6’s Wayland session itself has known regressions—wake-from-sleep flicker, cursor lag, and window redraw issues—that amplify browser rendering bugs ([Arch Linux Forums][6]).

---

## Diagnostics

1. **Check Ozone platform in `brave://gpu`**

   * Look for `Ozone platform = x11` — if you’re on Wayland, this is the culprit ([GitHub][7]).
2. **Inspect GPU feature status**

   * In `brave://gpu`, verify if “Graphics Feature Status” shows “Hardware accelerated” or if it has fallen back to software ([EndeavourOS][8]).

---

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Force Wayland with Ozone Flags

Add the following to `~/.config/brave-flags.conf` (create it if missing):

```
--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform
--ozone-platform-hint=auto
```

Or launch directly:

```bash
brave --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
```

This ensures Brave uses native Wayland rather than X11 ([GitHub][9], [GitHub][7]).

### 2. Toggle Hardware Acceleration

In **Settings → System**, disable “Use hardware acceleration when available,” restart Brave, and check for improvements. If it helps, you can leave acceleration off or revisit once upstream GPU drivers stabilize ([EndeavourOS][8]).

### 3. Downgrade or Switch Package Source

If you’re on Flatpak/AUR and recent updates broke Ozone support, try downgrading to a known good commit or switch to the official repository build:

```bash
flatpak update --commit=<old-commit> com.brave.Browser
# or
sudo pacman -S brave
```

Users found that reverting to a commit from early April 2024 resolved invisibility and flicker issues ([Brave Community][10]).

### 4. Fallback to X11 Session (Temporary)

If Wayland remains unstable, log out and select a “Plasma on X11” session at the login screen. X11 mode avoids Wayland-specific bugs until KDE or Brave ships a fix ([Arch Linux Forums][6]).

---

## Example: Creating `brave-flags.conf`

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config
cat <<EOF > ~/.config/brave-flags.conf
--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform
--ozone-platform-hint=auto
EOF
```

Then simply run `brave` as usual—no extra flags needed in your launcher ([GitHub][7]).

## Further Resources

* **Brave Community Desktop Support**
  Discuss performance issues across Linux Desktop environments for ongoing fixes and patches ([Brave Community][11]).
* **KDE Plasma Wayland Stability Reports**
  Track upstream Plasma 6 Wayland regressions and workarounds on the Arch forums ([Arch Linux Forums][6]).

With these steps, Brave should run smoothly under Plasma 6 Wayland. If problems persist, consider filing a bug against the Brave or KDE GitHub issue trackers, including your GPU, kernel version, and the exact `brave://gpu` logs.
