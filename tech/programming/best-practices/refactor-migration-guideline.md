# Cross-Language Refactor / Migration Guideline

> $refactor $migration $rewrite $cross-language $ai-agents $claude-code $codex
> $strangler-fig $characterization-tests $differential-testing
> $contract-preservation $idiomatic-code $llm-code-translation

A canonical, **language-agnostic** guideline for refactoring/rewriting a
project from one technology to another (Bash → Rust, Python → Go,
Ruby → TypeScript, JS → Rust, Java → Kotlin, …). Intended to be loaded
as a prompt / skill injection by AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex
CLI, Cursor, Aider, Cline, …) **every time** a cross-language
refactor/rewrite is undertaken.

This document is the source of truth for "how we rewrite". It is *not*
a discussion of *when* to rewrite — assume the decision is made.

---

## 0. Non-Negotiables (read this section first)

A cross-language refactor in this guideline is a **full rewrite**, not
a transliteration. The agent must internalize and enforce these
non-negotiable rules:

1. **Preserve the external contract.** The user-facing API, CLI
   surface, exit codes, stdout/stderr shape, on-disk and wire formats,
   feature set, and observable behavior must remain compatible with
   the source system (within the explicit parity boundary set in
   Phase A). Where parity is intentionally broken, document it as an
   ADR.
2. **Re-derive the internal implementation from the contract, not from
   the source code.** Design must flow from the extracted specification
   plus the target language's idioms — *not* from the source's module
   layout, class hierarchy, error model, or concurrency strategy.
3. **No transliteration.** Mechanical mapping of source-language
   constructs into target-language syntax is forbidden. Specifically:
   - Shell pipelines must not become subprocess chains; redesign in the
     target's I/O primitives.
   - OOP class hierarchies must not be mirrored 1:1 into Go interfaces,
     Rust traits, or functional types.
   - Exception flow must not be mechanically converted into
     `Result`/`error` returns (and vice versa) — re-derive the error
     model from the contract.
   - The original concurrency model (threads vs. async vs. green
     threads vs. processes) must not be copied; choose what fits the
     target language and workload.
4. **Improve where the new ecosystem offers leverage.** Stronger
   typing, native async, structured logging, real parallelism, better
   packaging, single-binary distribution, faster I/O — use them.
   Improvements **inside** the contract are encouraged; behavioral
   changes **across** the contract require an explicit ADR.
5. **No scope creep.** The rewrite preserves features and adds nothing
   that did not exist in the source. New features ship in a separate
   change *after* the rewrite is decommissioned-complete.
   See [§7 anti-patterns: second-system effect](#7-anti-patterns--failure-modes-named-in-the-literature).
6. **Gated phase model.** Phases A→F (see [§3](#3-mandatory-phase-model))
   are mandatory and ordered. Skipping or reordering phases is a
   defect; agents must refuse to advance until the previous phase's
   artifacts exist.

> The dominant failure mode of LLM-driven rewrites is **transliteration
> smell** — code that is syntactically the target language but
> structurally the source language. The whole point of this guideline
> is to make that failure mode hard to commit.

## 1. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Contract** | The external, observable surface a system promises: CLI flags, subcommands, exit codes, stdout/stderr shape, HTTP routes, request/response schemas, headers, error payloads, on-disk formats, wire formats, env vars, config schema, semver promises. The contract is what users (humans, scripts, integrating services) *depend on*. |
| **Transliteration** | Mechanical mapping of source-language constructs into target-language syntax, preserving source-side structure. Always wrong in this guideline. |
| **Characterization test** | A test that documents the *current* observable behavior of the source system before any rewrite. Captures both documented and undocumented behavior. (Feathers, *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*.) |
| **Golden test / approval test / snapshot test** | A characterization test where the expected output is a stored fixture; deviations are diffed and explicitly re-approved. |
| **Differential test** | A test that runs the same input through the source and target implementations and asserts output equivalence (with documented allowed differences). |
| **Property test** | A test that asserts an invariant holds for randomly-generated inputs, language-neutrally. Runs against both source and target. |
| **Parity test** | Any of {characterization, golden, differential, property} test that gates the rewrite. |
| **Parity boundary** | The explicit, documented set of behaviors the rewrite **does** and **does not** preserve. Anything outside the boundary requires an ADR. |
| **Translation smell** | An idiom that betrays source-language origin in target-language code (e.g., getter/setter methods in Go, `Vec<Box<dyn Trait>>` mirroring a Java class hierarchy in Rust, callback chains where async/await fits). |
| **Strangler Fig** | An incremental rewrite pattern: route traffic between old and new behind a seam; grow the new implementation until the old can be removed. |
| **ADR** | Architecture Decision Record. A short doc capturing context, decision, and consequences for one significant choice during the rewrite. |

## 2. The Core Principle (one paragraph for prompt injection)

> A cross-language rewrite preserves the **external contract** (CLI
> surface, API, observable behavior, on-disk/wire formats, semver
> promises) and **re-derives the internal implementation** in the
> target language's idioms. The agent must (a) extract the contract
> from the source as machine-checkable artifacts, (b) freeze the
> source's current behavior in characterization tests, (c) design the
> new system from the contract — not from the source code — using the
> target language's official style guides and idiomatic ecosystem,
> (d) implement under anti-transliteration guardrails, (e) verify with
> golden/property/differential/fuzz/shadow tests against the frozen
> behavior, and (f) cut over via parallel-run with an explicit
> rollback. Transliteration is forbidden. Scope creep is forbidden.

---

## 3. Mandatory Phase Model

Six gated phases. Each phase has required artifacts. Agents must
refuse to advance until the previous phase's artifacts exist.

### Phase A — Contract Extraction

**Goal:** Produce a machine-checkable description of what the source
system *promises*, independent of how it is implemented.

**Required artifacts:**

- `contract/` directory in the new project, containing:
  - **CLI contract** (if applicable):
    - `cli-surface.md` — every command, subcommand, flag (short/long),
      argument, default, required/optional status, environment-variable
      bindings, config-file precedence.
    - `exit-codes.md` — every documented exit code and its meaning.
    - `stdout-stderr-shape.md` — output formats (plain, JSON, table),
      colorization rules, TTY/non-TTY behavior, locale handling, line
      endings.
    - `help-text/` — captured `--help` output for every command, as
      golden fixtures.
  - **Service / API contract** (if applicable):
    - `openapi.yaml` (or `.json`) for HTTP, `*.proto` for gRPC,
      GraphQL SDL, AsyncAPI for messaging.
    - `error-payloads.md` — error shapes, status codes, idempotency
      semantics.
    - `headers.md` — auth, content-type, custom headers, rate-limit
      semantics.
  - **Data contracts** (if applicable):
    - `on-disk-formats.md` — file formats, layouts, compatibility
      windows.
    - `wire-formats.md` — network protocols, framing, versioning.
    - `db-schemas/` — DDL or schema-extraction output.
    - `config-schema.json` — JSON Schema of any config file.
  - **Compatibility envelope:**
    - `semver-promises.md` — what is considered breaking vs.
      additive; current version; what cannot change.
    - `parity-boundary.md` — explicit list of behaviors the rewrite
      will **not** preserve (justified with ADR links).
- `adr/` directory initialized with `0001-rewrite-decision.md` and
  `0002-parity-boundary.md`.

**How to extract:**

1. Read user-facing docs, `--help` output, man pages, README.
2. Capture every documented exit code; capture every documented HTTP
   status. Run the source binary against representative inputs and
   record outputs.
3. For HTTP services, capture production traffic with mitmproxy/
   GoReplay/WireMock if possible.
4. For libraries with public APIs, list every exported symbol and its
   documented contract.
5. Treat **observed behavior** as authoritative when it diverges from
   documented behavior — users depend on what the system does, not
   what the docs say (see Chesterton's Fence in [§7](#7-anti-patterns--failure-modes-named-in-the-literature)).

**Gate:** No source-code reading for design purposes until Phase A
artifacts are present and reviewed.

### Phase B — Freeze Behavior (Characterization Tests Against the Source)

**Goal:** Lock current observable behavior into automated,
machine-runnable tests that pass against the **source** today and will
later be required to pass against the **target**.

**Required artifacts:**

- `parity-tests/` directory containing:
  - **Golden / approval tests** for CLI: every documented command
    invocation with stdout/stderr/exit-code fixtures. Use
    `bats-core` / `cram` / `trycmd` / `insta` / `ApprovalTests`
    according to host language for the harness.
  - **HTTP/wire replay tests**: recorded cassettes (VCR) or
    deterministic mocks (WireMock).
  - **Characterization unit tests** for any library API: each public
    function called with representative inputs, observed output
    pinned.
  - **Property tests** (where invariants exist): defined in
    language-neutral terms so the same suite can be re-implemented
    against the target. Frameworks: Hypothesis (Python), proptest
    (Rust), QuickCheck (Rust/Haskell), fast-check (JS/TS).
- All tests **must pass against the source** before Phase C begins.
- A **coverage report** of the parity tests against the contract —
  identifying which parts of the contract are covered by parity
  tests vs. which are documentation-only.

**Gate:** Parity tests green against the source. Coverage gaps in the
contract are explicitly accepted (with ADR) or filled before Phase C.

### Phase C — Idiomatic Design (From the Contract, Without the Source Code)

**Goal:** Produce a design for the new system using only the contract
and the target language's idioms. The source code is **not an input**.

**Required artifacts:**

- `design/` directory containing:
  - `architecture.md` — module layout, key abstractions, error model,
    concurrency model, I/O model, dependency choices. Must justify
    each choice by reference to:
    1. A specific contract requirement, AND
    2. A specific target-language idiom guideline (Effective Go, Rust
       API Guidelines, PEP 8/20, .NET Framework Design Guidelines,
       Kotlin coding conventions, Google C++ Style Guide, C++ Core
       Guidelines, …).
  - `dependencies.md` — chosen libraries with rationale (prefer
    target-ecosystem idiomatic libraries; e.g., `clap` for Rust CLI,
    `cobra` for Go CLI, `click`/`typer` for Python CLI, `oclif` for
    Node CLI).
  - `error-model.md` — designed natively for the target (Go's
    explicit `error` returns and `errors.Is/As`; Rust's `Result<T, E>`
    with `?` and `thiserror`/`anyhow`; Python exceptions with
    explicit hierarchy; etc.). May **not** mirror the source error
    model 1:1.
  - `concurrency-model.md` — designed natively (goroutines/channels,
    `tokio`/`async-std`, `asyncio`/`trio`, JVM virtual threads,
    Node event loop, …). May **not** mirror the source.
  - ADRs (`adr/0003-*`, `0004-*`, …) for every non-trivial choice.

**Rule of separation:** Phase C may read the contract artifacts from
Phase A and the target-language style guides. It **may not** read the
source code. This is the most important guardrail in the whole model;
it is the single highest-leverage step for preventing transliteration.

**Gate:** Design is reviewed against the contract (every contract
requirement maps to a design element) and against the target-language
canon (every design element justified by an idiom).

### Phase D — Implementation Under Anti-Transliteration Guardrails

**Goal:** Write the new implementation, idiomatically, against the
design.

**Mandatory guardrails (refusal rules for AI agents):**

- The agent **must refuse** to "translate function X from source to
  target". The valid request is "implement contract feature Y per the
  design".
- The agent **must refuse** to keep source-side variable names,
  function names, module names, or directory names unless they
  happen to match target idioms.
- The agent **must refuse** to emit code patterns from the source
  language's style when an idiomatic target equivalent exists. See
  [§6 refusal list](#6-refusal-list-translation-smells-to-reject) for
  concrete examples.
- The agent **must consult** the target-language style guide for every
  non-trivial construct.
- The agent **must emit a parity test alongside every implemented
  contract feature**, before merging it.

**Implementation-time review pass (per change):**

- Does this code look like source-language code mechanically converted
  into target syntax? If yes — redesign.
- Are error paths idiomatic to the target?
- Is concurrency expressed in target primitives?
- Are public types/names target-idiomatic?
- Are dependencies target-ecosystem-native?

### Phase E — Differential, Property, Fuzz, Shadow Validation

**Goal:** Prove the target's observable behavior matches the source's
across all parity-test classes.

**Required artifacts and runs:**

- **Golden / approval tests:** the Phase-B suite passes byte-for-byte
  against the target (with documented, ADR-justified diffs only).
- **Property tests:** the Phase-B property suite passes against the
  target with at least the same input-space coverage.
- **Differential tests:** for each parity-relevant function/route, run
  the same inputs against source and target and assert equivalence.
  Use [Trail of Bits **DIFFER**] for transformed-program differential
  testing where applicable.
- **Fuzz campaign:** coverage-guided fuzzing (AFL++, libFuzzer,
  cargo-fuzz, jazzer, OSS-Fuzz harness if appropriate) for at least
  the duration committed in `parity-boundary.md`. No crashes; no
  divergence from source on any minimized input.
- **Shadow traffic** (for services): tee production traffic to the
  new implementation; log diffs; investigate every divergence;
  resolve or ADR.
- **Performance baseline:** measured against the source for the
  representative workloads in `parity-tests/perf/`. Regressions
  outside the documented envelope block cutover.

**Gate:** All parity tests green; fuzz campaign clean; shadow traffic
divergences resolved; performance within envelope.

### Phase F — Parallel-Run, Canary, Cutover, Decommission

**Goal:** Move traffic from source to target with rollback at every
step.

**Required artifacts and steps:**

1. **Parallel-run** (a.k.a. dark launch): both implementations process
   traffic; only source's responses are user-visible; target's
   responses are logged and diffed. Run until divergence rate is
   acceptable.
2. **Canary**: route a small percentage (1–5%) of user traffic to the
   target. Monitor error rate, latency, resource usage. Roll back on
   regression.
3. **Progressive rollout**: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%, gated by SLO
   adherence at each step.
4. **Cutover**: source goes read-only / off; target is the system of
   record.
5. **Rollback plan**: at every step, a documented, tested procedure
   to revert traffic to the source.
6. **Decommission**: after a confidence period (days–weeks), remove
   source code from the repo and announce end-of-life. Capture
   lessons in `adr/9999-postmortem.md`.

**Gate:** Cutover is irreversible only after the confidence period;
until then, rollback must remain possible.

## 4. Strategy Patterns (When to Use Which)

| Pattern | When to use | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Strangler Fig** | Long-lived production system; cannot stop the world; replace component-by-component behind a routing seam. Default for services. | https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html · https://martinfowler.com/articles/2024-strangler-fig-rewrite.html |
| **Branch by Abstraction** | Inside one codebase: introduce an abstraction over the part being rewritten; ship old and new behind a flag; flip. Default for libraries / monoliths being modernized in-place. | https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html · https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/modernization-decomposing-monoliths/branch-by-abstraction.html |
| **Parallel Run** | The rewrite must prove behavioral equivalence under live traffic before cutover. | https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2021/11/parallel-run.html |
| **Traffic Shadowing** | Service rewrites; replay production traffic against the new implementation without user impact. | https://emissary-ingress.dev/docs/3.9/topics/using/shadowing/ · https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/traffic_splitting.html |
| **Canary / Progressive rollout** | Final cutover step. | https://goreplay.org/blog/canary-deployment-strategy-20250808133113/ |
| **Big-bang rewrite** | **Default-prohibited.** Allowed only when the system is small enough that the entire rewrite fits in one parity-test gated cycle, and when there is no live production traffic to migrate. Document explicitly in ADR. | https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/ |

## 6. Refusal List (Translation Smells to Reject)

The agent **must refuse to emit, and must flag in review**, any of the
following. Each item is named so reviewers can cite the specific smell.

1. **Class-hierarchy-as-trait-hierarchy.** Mirroring a deep
   inheritance tree from an OOP source into Rust traits, Go
   interfaces, or Haskell typeclasses 1:1. Re-derive the abstraction
   from the contract.
2. **Shell-pipeline-as-subprocess-chain.** Re-implementing a Bash
   pipeline (`a | b | c`) by spawning `a`, `b`, `c` as subprocesses
   in the target. The target should do the I/O natively.
3. **Exception-to-Result mechanical mapping.** Wrapping every
   try/except in `Result<T, E>` (or vice versa) without redesigning
   what is actually a recoverable error vs. a bug vs. a logic
   precondition.
4. **GIL-shaped concurrency in a non-GIL target.** Carrying over
   Python's "one big lock + threads" model into Go/Rust, where the
   idiomatic model is goroutines/channels or `tokio` tasks.
5. **Callback chains where async/await fits.** Translating a JS
   callback-style API into the target without using the target's
   native async primitives.
6. **Getter/setter methods in Go.** Go uses direct field access for
   public fields, named accessors only when behavior is non-trivial.
7. **`Vec<Box<dyn Trait>>` mirroring a Java `List<Interface>` when a
   sum type (enum) is what the domain actually has.**
8. **`null`/`None` everywhere instead of typed absence.** Rust
   `Option<T>`, Kotlin nullable types, TS strict-null-checks should
   carry semantic weight, not be a syntactic translation of
   `someVar == null` checks.
9. **String-typed configuration.** If the source passed config as
   stringly-typed env vars, the target should parse them into a
   typed config struct at startup.
10. **Source-side directory names / module names / file names** in
    the target tree when those names violate target conventions
    (e.g., `utils/` and `helpers/` in Go; PascalCase files in
    snake_case ecosystems).
11. **Mirrored test structure.** Translating the source's test files
    1:1 instead of writing target-idiomatic tests against the parity
    contract.
12. **Comments translated verbatim.** Source-language comments
    explaining source-side idioms are often nonsense in the target
    language.
13. **Re-creating shell-isms in higher-level targets.** Re-implementing
    `find`, `grep`, `xargs`, `sed` calls as subprocess invocations
    when the target ecosystem has native libraries (e.g., `walkdir`,
    `regex`, `serde_json` in Rust; `pathlib`, `re`, `json` in Python).
14. **Hand-rolled CLI parsing translated from `getopts`/`argparse`.**
    Use the target's idiomatic CLI library (`clap`, `cobra`, `click`,
    `oclif`, `picocli`).
15. **Mirroring the source's serialization format choices when the
    contract permits change.** (Caveat: the contract often does *not*
    permit change. Check Phase A.)
16. **Logging strings instead of structured fields** in a target that
    has structured logging (Go's `slog`, Rust's `tracing`, Python's
    `structlog`).

## 7. Anti-Patterns / Failure Modes Named in the Literature

- **Transliteration smell** ("Java in Go", "C in Rust"). Effective Go
  explicitly warns against it. https://www.gocloudstudio.com/post/writing-idiomatic-go-patterns-that-separate-clean-code-from-java-in-go/
- **Second-system effect** (Brooks, *Mythical Man-Month*). The
  rewrite becomes the dumping ground for every deferred improvement,
  generalization, and feature. Result: bloated, late, and worse than
  the system it replaces. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect · https://albrightlabs.com/blog/avoiding-second-system-syndrome-in-code-rewrites/
- **Chesterton's Fence.** Legacy code often contains seemingly
  pointless logic that actually encodes a hard-won bug fix or
  regulatory requirement. Removing it silently reintroduces the bug.
  Characterization tests (Phase B) are the antidote. https://alexkondov.com/legacy-code-and-chestersons-fence/ · https://fourweekmba.com/the-chestertons-fence-problem-ai-removing-things-it-doesnt-understand/
- **Undocumented-behavior surprise.** Users depend on observed
  behavior, not documented behavior. Mitigation: golden tests +
  shadow traffic + extended dual-run.
- **Scope creep during rewrite.** Mitigation: enforce Larson's
  derisk/enable/finish gates and the "no new features" rule in
  [§0](#0-non-negotiables-read-this-section-first). https://lethain.com/migrations/ · https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep
- **Joel Spolsky's warning** ("Things You Should Never Do, Part I").
  Big-bang rewrites discard accumulated bug fixes and burn schedule.
  This guideline treats it as a *constraint to mitigate*, not a veto:
  Strangler Fig + characterization tests + parallel-run address the
  specific failure mode Joel named. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/
- **LLM-specific failure modes.** Per IBM/ICSE 2024 *Lost in
  Translation*: 15 categories of bugs introduced by LLMs translating
  code, with correct-translation rates between 2.1% and 47.3%
  depending on model and language pair. Categories include type
  mismatches, missing error handling, semantic gaps (e.g., integer
  overflow semantics differ between Java and C), and hallucinated
  target APIs. https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03109
- **Semantic gap blindness.** Java integer arithmetic is defined
  modulo 2³²; naive C translation introduces UB. Java/C# `String`
  immutability differs from C `char*`. JS `==` vs. `===`. The agent
  must check for semantic-gap categories per the target/source pair.
  https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2025/EECS-2025-174.pdf
- **Evaluation-harness false positives.** A test suite written against
  the target may "pass" while still violating the source contract,
  because the test author transliterated the test too. Parity tests
  must be **derived from the contract**, not from the source tests.
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.02195

## 8. AI-Agent Prompting Tactics (To Be Embedded When This Doc Is Loaded)

When this guideline is loaded into an AI agent's context, the agent
should additionally apply these meta-tactics. These tactics are
synthesized from Anthropic's and OpenAI's published prompt-engineering
guidance and from the LLM-translation literature.

1. **Two-step prompting (extract → design).** First prompt extracts
   the contract. Second prompt designs from the contract — *and the
   second prompt does not include the source code in its context*.
   This separation is the single highest-leverage mitigation for
   transliteration.
2. **Affirmative idiom anchors beat negative rules.** "Use the `?`
   operator and `thiserror`-style enum errors" outperforms "don't
   translate try/except literally." Pair each refusal in
   [§6](#6-refusal-list-translation-smells-to-reject) with an
   affirmative idiom.
3. **Permission to say "I don't know".** For ambiguous contract gaps,
   require the agent to ask a clarification question rather than
   guess. The contract is authoritative; if it is silent, the human
   decides.
4. **Two-pass review.**
   - **Pass 1:** correctness against parity tests.
   - **Pass 2:** translation-smell review against
     [§6 refusal list](#6-refusal-list-translation-smells-to-reject).
     Frame: "Pretend you do not know what language this was
     originally written in. Does this code look like idiomatic
     [target]?"
5. **Differential-by-construction.** Every implemented feature ships
   with the parity test that pins it. No code without its test.
6. **Chain-of-thought scaffold in the prompt.**
   `extract → freeze → design → implement → verify → review`. Make
   the phase explicit in every interaction.
7. **Few-shot exemplars of idiomatic target code** beat abstract
   style-guide pointers. Include 1–3 high-quality target-language
   snippets at the start of Phase C and D.
8. **Architectural context as XML/structured blocks.** Wrap the
   contract, the design, and the implementation request in clearly
   delineated structured sections so the agent does not conflate
   "what to build" with "how the source built it."

## 9. Verification Tooling Roster

The following tools are recommended (use the target language's

## 10. Case Studies Worth Citing

A short list of real cross-language rewrites with primary-source
writeups. Use as design exemplars and in ADR justification.

| Project | Move | Lesson | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discord Read States** | Go → Rust | Preserved service API; Rust's memory model eliminated GC-induced tail-latency spikes. Initial port was deliberately rough, then redesigned. | https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust |
| **Cloudflare Pingora** | NGINX/C → Rust | New proxy framework; preserved external behavior of the L7 platform, redesigned the substrate. | https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet |
| **Cloudflare ROFL** | NGINX module (C/Lua) → Rust | Drop-in replacement at the operator level; idiomatic Rust internally. | https://blog.cloudflare.com/rust-nginx-module |
| **Cloudflare FL2** | NGINX/LuaJIT → Rust | Major substrate replacement under a stable platform contract. | https://blog.cloudflare.com/it-it/20-percent-internet-upgrade/ |
| **Mozilla Stylo / Quantum CSS** | C++ → Rust | Incremental in-tree replacement of a hot subsystem (CSS engine), Quantum project. | https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/ |
| **Astral `ruff`** | Python lint tooling → Rust | Single tool replacing Flake8 + ~90 plugins, Black, isort, etc. Preserved CLI/config contracts of the originals. | https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff |
| **Astral `uv`** | pip/virtualenv/Poetry/pipenv → Rust | Replaced the Python packaging stack with a single Rust tool; preserved workflow contract. | https://github.com/astral-sh/uv · https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging |
| **esbuild** | JS bundler tooling → Go | Workflow preservation, internal redesign. FAQ explicitly documents intentional behavioral differences. | https://esbuild.github.io/faq/ |
| **swc, oxc, biome, Bun** | JS/TS tooling → Rust / Zig | Same pattern: preserve developer workflow, redesign substrate. | https://swc.rs/ · https://oxc.rs/ · https://biomejs.dev/blog/annoucing-biome/ · https://bun.com/docs |
| **Deno 2** | — | Explicitly *not* a Node clone in Rust. Useful as a stated parity-boundary example. | https://deno.com/blog/v2.0 |
| **ripgrep** | grep replacement, Rust | Intentionally **not** a drop-in `grep`. Cite as a parity-boundary example: where deviation from source behavior is a *design goal*, declare it. | https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md · https://burntsushi.net/ripgrep/ |
| **fd** | find replacement, Rust | Default-case-insensitive, respects `.gitignore`. Same parity-boundary lesson as ripgrep. | https://github.com/sharkdp/fd |
| **eza** | ls replacement, Rust | Same parity-boundary lesson; modern defaults. | https://eza.rocks/ · https://github.com/eza-community/eza |
| **bat** | cat with syntax highlighting, Rust | Preserves piping/redirection contract; adds modern features when TTY. | https://github.com/sharkdp/bat |
| **gitoxide** | git internals, Rust | Idiomatic pure-Rust Git; deliberately not a transliteration of C. | https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide |

**Negative / cautionary:**

- **Netscape 6 / Mozilla** (the original "Things You Should Never Do"
  case) — big-bang rewrite, multi-year delay, market loss. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/

**Caveat — Dropbox Magic Pocket "Go → Rust" rewrite:** widely cited
in secondary sources but **no primary Dropbox post** explicitly frames
Magic Pocket as a Go-to-Rust *rewrite*. Cite the primary Magic Pocket
posts for storage-design context and the QCon talk for the Rust
optimization angle only:
- https://dropbox.tech/tech/2016/05/inside-the-magic-pocket/

## 11. LLM Code Translation: Research Findings

Findings the agent should internalize *before* a rewrite, not learn
from regression.

- **Lost in Translation** (IBM, ICSE 2024). 1,700 code samples,
  multiple LLMs, 5 languages. Correct-translation rates: 2.1% to
  47.3%. **Fifteen categories** of translation bugs identified
  (type mismatches, logic errors, missing error handling, semantic
  gaps, hallucinated APIs, …). Targeted prompt-crafting addressing
  specific symptom categories improved performance ~5.5% on average.
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03109 ·
  https://research.ibm.com/publications/lost-in-translation-a-study-of-bugs-introduced-by-large-language-models-while-translating-code ·
  https://github.com/Intelligent-CAT-Lab/PLTranslationEmpirical
- **Migrating Code At Scale With LLMs At Google** (2025). 39
  migrations over 12 months, 595 changes, 93,574 edits, 74.45%
  generated by LLM, ~50% time savings reported by developers.
  Methodology: find migration points → LLM generates fix → validate
  against tests → iterate. Key takeaway: success is gated on the
  *validation* loop, not on raw generation. https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09691
- **LLM-Based Code Translation Needs Formal Compositional Reasoning**
  (UC Berkeley, 2025). LLMs fail predictably on semantic gaps
  (e.g., Java mod-2³² integer arithmetic vs. C undefined behavior).
  Proposes a **feature-mapping** approach: predefined translation
  rules for known-hard primitives, with static checks enforcing
  compliance. Hybrid rule-based + LLM beats LLM-only. https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2025/EECS-2025-174.pdf
- **Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation** — https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19894
- **Scalable, Validated Code Translation of Entire Projects** (Amazon
  Science) — https://assets.amazon.science/0e/ab/c10459dd4013a7c02f09b8c96f3f/scalable-validated-code-translation-of-entire-projects-using-large-language-models.pdf
- **TransCoder** (Meta, NeurIPS 2020) — unsupervised cross-language
  translation baseline. Useful as historical context. https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03511 · https://github.com/facebookresearch/TransCoder

**Operational consequence:** the parity-test gate in Phase E is *not
optional*. The published correct-translation rates make unsupervised
LLM rewrites untrustworthy by default; the parity tests are what move
the rewrite from "plausible code" to "verified rewrite".

```
[ ] Phase A — Contract Extraction
    [ ] contract/cli-surface.md
    [ ] contract/exit-codes.md
    [ ] contract/stdout-stderr-shape.md
    [ ] contract/help-text/*.golden
    [ ] contract/openapi.yaml (if applicable)

    [ ] contract/parity-boundary.md
    [ ] adr/0001-rewrite-decision.md
    [ ] adr/0002-parity-boundary.md

[ ] Phase B — Freeze Behavior
    [ ] parity-tests/golden/ — passes against SOURCE
    [ ] parity-tests/replay/ — passes against SOURCE (if service)
    [ ] parity-tests/characterization/ — passes against SOURCE
    [ ] parity-tests/property/ — passes against SOURCE
    [ ] parity-tests/perf/ — baseline recorded
    [ ] Coverage report mapping contract → parity tests

[ ] Phase C — Idiomatic Design
    [ ] design/architecture.md
    [ ] design/dependencies.md
    [ ] design/error-model.md
    [ ] design/concurrency-model.md
    [ ] adr/0003-*, 0004-*, ... for non-trivial choices
    [ ] Phase C performed WITHOUT reading source code

[ ] Phase D — Implementation
    [ ] Anti-transliteration guardrails active
    [ ] Each implemented feature ships with its parity test
    [ ] Translation-smell review pass on each change

[ ] Phase E — Verification
    [ ] All Phase-B parity tests pass against TARGET
    [ ] Property tests pass against TARGET
    [ ] Differential tests against source — clean
    [ ] Fuzz campaign — no crashes, no divergences
    [ ] Shadow traffic — divergences resolved or ADR'd
    [ ] Performance baseline within documented envelope

[ ] Phase F — Cutover
    [ ] Parallel-run period complete
    [ ] Canary 1–5% — clean
    [ ] Progressive rollout 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
    [ ] Rollback procedure tested at each step
    [ ] Decommission of source after confidence period
    [ ] adr/9999-postmortem.md
