# AWS: Auto Scaling Groups

Auto Scaling Groups:

An Auto Scaling group is an AWS feature that allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in a group based on defined conditions
You set a minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances for the group
Auto Scaling adds instances (scales out) when demand increases and removes instances (scales in) when demand decreases
Scaling can be based on metrics like CPU utilization, or on a schedule
If an instance becomes unhealthy, Auto Scaling automatically replaces it to maintain the desired capacity
This automation helps maintain application availability and performance in a cost-effective manner
